    <platform>iOS 17+ (iPhone and iPad friendly, supports Dynamic Type)</platform>
    <language>Swift 5.9</language>
    <ui_framework>SwiftUI with Scenes + App lifecycle in Affirm</ui_framework>
    <state>ObservableObject/Bindable models with AppStorage/UserDefaults persistence</state>
    <animations>SwiftUI animations inspired by the icon’s pacing and gradients</animations>
  </technology_stack>

  <core_features>
    <functionality>
      - 🃏 Swipeable card deck with 3D rotation animations
      - ❤️ Save favorite affirmations
      - 📂 8 categories: Self-Love, Confidence, Gratitude, Success, Health, Relationships, Morning, Evening
      - ✏️ Create custom affirmations
    </functionality>
    <personalization>
      - Respect the app icon’s palette and typography hints; provide theme/intensity controls where the README suggests customization.
      - Surface any onboarding or guidance noted in the documentation to help first-time users.
    </personalization>
    <accessibility>
      - Ensure VoiceOver-friendly labels, high contrast variants, 44 pt minimum touch targets, and adherence to the Fibonacci spacing grid specified in the App Reject Checklist.
    </accessibility>
  </core_features>

  <ui_layout>
    <main_structure>
      - Layout mirrors standard SwiftUI idioms (tabs, cards, stacks) while keeping the navigation chrome minimal and focused on the app’s primary action.
      - Keep content responsive so that iPhone and iPad versions share a coherent structure, collapsing to single-column on compact width and expanding gracefully on large screens.
      - Tab/Navigation bar items use SF Symbols that reflect the app’s theme and maintain legibility.
    </main_structure>
    <elements>
      - - Confirm every release meets the items in /Users/home/Documents/iOS/dev-docs/checklists/app-reject-checklist.md (Guidelines 4.0, 3.1.2, 2.1, 2.3.7). Keep this section in sync with the shared checklist after validating layout/usability on the flagged devices, metadata links, Apple Pay, screenshot pricing, and IAP submissions.
      - - **Theme:** Stacked glowing cards with radiant sunburst
      - - **Primary Colors:** Warm coral, orange, golden yellow sunburst
      - - **Background:** Coral to salmon gradient with sparkles
      - Tab bar and toolbars use frosted glass/ultra-thin materials when appropriate to echo the icon’s depth.
    </elements>
  </ui_layout>

  <design_system>
    <color_palette>
      - #FF6B6B
      - #FF8C42
      - #FFD93D
      - #FFA07A
      - #E85D5D
    </color_palette>
    <typography>
      - System font stack (SF Pro Text + Inter fallbacks) with weights ranging from regular for body to semibold/bold for titles so hierarchy matches the app’s tone.
      - Font sizes follow the [11,14,17,21,27,34,42] scale called out in the prompt instructions and adjust via Dynamic Type.
    </typography>
    <components>
      - Buttons, cards, and controls rely on rounded radii (4/8/13/21) and 44 pt touch zones. Disabled states fade the opacity and disable interactions.
      - Inputs and overlays use ultra-thin materials or gradients that blend with the app’s background, as noted in the README/design notes.
    </components>
    <animations>
      - Use SwiftUI’s easeInOut and spring timing for transitions, crossfades for content replacement, and optional shimmering effects inspired by the icon.
    </animations>
  </design_system>

  <data_models>
    <state>
      - Models follow an observable pattern and persist user preferences/data to survive relaunches.
      - Store business logic (timers, trackers, lists, etc.) in dedicated classes/structs rather than cluttering views.
    </state>
  </data_models>

  <key_interactions>
    <primary_flow>
      - Users launch the app, encounter the primary screen described above, and interact with the core feature set (timers, trackers, lists, etc.) captured from the README.
      - Actions provide haptic/visual feedback, and success states are animated using the colors from the palette.
    </primary_flow>
    <secondary_flow>
      - Settings or secondary tabs expose stats, personalization toggles, or informational content (Privacy, Terms, etc.) documented alongside the app.
    </secondary_flow>
  </key_interactions>

  <implementation_steps>
    <step number="1">
      <title>Foundation</title>
      <tasks>
        - Establish the SwiftUI app lifecycle, colors, typography, and general layout structures noted above.
        - Wire up any data persistence or timer engines referenced in the README.
      </tasks>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <title>Feature Implementation</title>
      <tasks>
        - Build out the screens, widgets, or interactions from the README (timers, stat dashboards, galleries, etc.).
        - Connect controls to the observable state, ensuring data flows are testable and state updates reflect the design.
      </tasks>
    </step>
    <step number="3">
      <title>Polish & Compliance</title>
      <tasks>
        - Apply Fibonacci spacing, check 44 pt touch targets, and document App Reject checklist validation.
        - Add accessibility metadata, Dynamic Type support, and design refinements to match the icon’s cues.
      </tasks>
    </step>
  </implementation_steps>

  <success_criteria>
    <functionality>
      - The core scenario described in the README runs reliably with animations/data persistence intact.
      - Secondary flows (settings, stats, onboarding) described or implied in documentation are accessible and polished.
    </functionality>
    <user_experience>
      - The interface is visually cohesive, uses the app icon’s palette, and feels intentional rather than simple default controls.
      - Spacing, typography, and animations follow the provided Fibonacci, typography, and radius systems.
    </user_experience>
    <technical_quality>
      - Code isolates business logic, keeps SwiftUI views declarative, and avoids unused frameworks (PassKit only used when needed per App Reject checklist notes).
      - Unit/preview coverage exists where helpful (timers, data stores, analytics stubs).
    </technical_quality>
    <design_polish>
      - Buttons, cards, and backgrounds mirror the icon’s glow, include subtle particles or gradients when referenced, and maintain high contrast.
      - Accessibility options (VoiceOver labels, high contrast, reduced motion toggles) are present or planned based on documentation.
    </design_polish>
  </success_criteria>

## iOS 26 LIQUID GLASS DESIGN SYSTEM

This app should follow Apple's iOS 26 Liquid Glass design language (WWDC 2025).
See `/Users/home/Documents/iOS/dev-docs/guides/design-system.md` for full details.

### Automatic Updates (just build with Xcode 26)
- Floating glass tab bars and sidebars
- Glass toolbar items with automatic grouping
- Controls animate with glass effects

### Navigation Pattern
Choose based on your app's needs:
- **TabView** - Great for iPhone-first apps with 3-5 main sections
- **NavigationSplitView** - Great for iPad/Mac-first or document-based apps
- **TabView + .sidebarAdaptable** - Universal apps that adapt to device

### Key iOS 26 Modifiers
```swift
// Glass effects
.glassEffect()                           // Apply glass to custom views
.buttonStyle(.glass)                     // Glass button style

// TabView enhancements
.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)   // Tab bar shrinks on scroll
.tabViewBottomAccessory { }              // Add view above tab bar
Tab(..., role: .search)                  // Search tab morphs into field

// NavigationSplitView enhancements
.backgroundExtensionEffect()             // Content extends under sidebar

// Toolbars
ToolbarSpacer(.fixed)                    // Group toolbar items
```

### Required Actions
1. Build with Xcode 26 (automatic glass appearance)
2. Remove opaque backgrounds blocking glass effects
3. Use `.glassEffect()` for custom floating elements
4. Update app icons with Icon Composer (multi-layer)

### Accessibility
- VoiceOver support with proper labels
- Dynamic Type support
- Minimum 44pt touch targets
- Reduced motion support

### Bundle Identifier
Use `caserlegal.` - Do NOT use `com.` prefix (won't sign).
